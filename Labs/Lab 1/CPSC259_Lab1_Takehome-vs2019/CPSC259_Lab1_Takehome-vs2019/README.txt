# Lab 1
## Information
### Purpose
Consumes a semi-formatted tide measurement file and determines if the corresponding tide is once- or twice-daily using a fast discrete Fourier transformation.
The tide measurement file is a txt file whose name corresponds to the name defined in the preprocessor directive.
It is a series of NUMBER_OF_READINGS tidal readings (in mm) taken hourly.

## Testing
- All zero of the apparently provided unit tests were run successfully
- Program produces same output as equivalent program implemented in Python

## Challenges
- Comments/instructions are somewhat unclear
- Formatting of provided code was inconsistent and challenging to read
- A single blank testcase is not "some helpful unit tests"
- While knowledge of how an FFT works is not necessary for this lab, it is unfamiliar to many students and unnecessarily makes the lab seem harder
    - I see no reason why the first lab could not have used math that we have learned and understand enough to actually know if we've implemented the program correctly
